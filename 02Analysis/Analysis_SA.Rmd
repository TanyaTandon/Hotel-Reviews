## Fitting the model
```{r}
lm_fit <- lm((Reviewer_Score^2) ~ ., data = train[ c(1,2,3,4,5,7,10,15,16, 19,20, 23,24,25,26,27,28,29,31,39,42,43,44,4)])

## NOTE: Response ^ 2 has been modeled as this provides better model diagnostics

summary(lm_fit)

```


## Checking model diagnostics
```{r}
plot(lm_fit)

hist(lm_fit$residuals)
```
